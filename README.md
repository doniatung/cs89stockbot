# Stockbot - CS89.11 Final Project
## Group 3 - Srishti Bagchi, Jason Cushman, Aiko Takata, Donia Tung
This repo includes all of the code used for our CS89.11 final project, Stockbot. Stockbot is a web app that integrates ibm Watson ML and Watson Discovery instances to provide users with robust, personalized projections about stock risk, as well as providing an easily accessible, consoldiated set of relevant news articles about stocks in question.
